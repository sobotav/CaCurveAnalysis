# Automated analysis of calcium-6 fluorescence curves
This repository contains MATLAB scripts with implementation of a method for automated analysis of fluorescence curves obtained from human calcium-6-loaded platelets. The method performance is demonstrated on four sets of fluorescence curves. The software is licensed under the GNU GPL v3. More details about the dataset and the method can be found in the following study:

## Data analysis
The fluorescence curves were obtained from 96 and 1536-well plate assays with human calcium-6-loaded platelets. In the 96-well plate the tested compound was pre-incubated, so the fluorescence curve shows only the response to the agonist (collagen-related peptide, CRP, or thrombin). In the 1536-well plate the tested compound was added first, followed by the agonist addition. Since the fluorescent curves are  slightly different for each type of the well plate, they are analyzed by two distinct functions: `analyzeData_96.m` for the 96-well plate and `analyzeData_1536.m` for the 1536-well plate.

The input parameters of the analysis are set up at the beginning of the script. The following parameters are used for the curves from 96-well plates:

```
% parameters of the analysis
inputParams.smoothMethod            = 'loess';          % method of signal smoothing
inputParams.smoothSpan              = 0.1;              % smoothing span
inputParams.peakStart               = 20;               % time when the peak starts
inputParams.windowFirstMaximum      = [0,200];          % where to search for the first maximum
inputParams.longestTimeToPeak       = 250;              % longest time to peak
inputParams.thirdSlopeStart         = 350;              % third slope start time
inputParams.thirdSlopeEnd           = 500;              % third slope end time
inputParams.showGraphs              = 1;                % graphs should be shown (1/0)
inputParams.saveGraphs              = 1;                % graphs should be saved (1/0)
inputParams.pathSaveGraphs          = 'graphs';         % path for saving the graphs
inputParams.nameSaveGraphs          = nameLoad;         % file name for saving the graphs
```

For the 1536-well plate, two more parameters are added, to indicate the time windows for the compound and agonist addition effects:

```
inputParams.windowCompoundAddition  = [0,100];          % time window for the compound addition effect
inputParams.windowAgonistAddition   = [200,300];        % time window for the agonist addition effect
```

The results are saved in the `results` matrix for each fluorescence curve. The order of the saved parameters is described in the variable `resultsLabel`:
```
AUC
Ca increase
Median fluorescence before peak start
Time of the peak
Peak fluorescence
Slope 1
Slope 1 duration
Slope 2
Slope 2 duration
Slope 3
Slope 3 duration
```

Please note that for the 1536-well plate the output parameter `Median fluorescence before peak start` is replaced by the parameters `Median fluorescence before the compound addition` and `Median fluorescence before the agonist addition`.

### Visualization
Some of the parameters are visualized as indicated in the figure below.

Please note that the fluorescence curves from 96-well plates do not contain the parameters related to the compound and agonist addition because the compound was pre-incubated. In addition, there is no Slope #2 in CRP curves from 96-well plates.

## Available data sets

### Thrombin, 1536-well plate
These are examples of fluorescence curves from human calcium-6 loaded platelets stimulated with thrombin (4 nM) in 96 well plate with FLIPR. The fluorescence curves are analyzed and visualized by running the script `dataAnalysis_Thr_n02.m`. If the script is executed well, the following figure should appear:
